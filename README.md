# Introduction
Examples using Anchor and Native Rust SVM.
Do NOT use this in production. This is a learning
in public exercise.

# Anchor programs
- `spl-demo` is a simple program that demonstrates how to use the SPL token program. 
  Mint, transfer, and usage of Wrapped SOL. Also demonstrates idempotent ATA creation
- `token-2022` demonstrates usage of metadata extension in Token 2022 (Extension) Program.
  Creates, transfer, mint, etc.
- `puppet` and `puppet-master` demonstrates usage of CPI and how to call another program using Anchor CPI feature. Good for breaking down a complex program into smaller pieces
