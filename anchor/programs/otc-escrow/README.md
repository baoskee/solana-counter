# Escrow Program
- Takes a deposit from maker, and desired token and amount from taker
- Holds the deposit until taker claims the tokens with requisite desired token
- Close account after

## Improvements
- Maker can withdraw tokens
- Make taker optional, so that anyone can perform the OTC swap 
- Optional expiration date that disables claiming after a certain time or date.
